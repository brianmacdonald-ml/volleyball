						Valued Customer,
					</p>

					<p style="color:#E0E0E0;font-family:verdana,news gothic,arial,heltevica,serif;font-size:16px;line-height:26px;">
						Not long ago, the StatEasy team announced the availability of our most feature-rich and user-friendly release to date, StatEasy - Release 9. From the moment that release was made available, the team has been hard at work on the next release, and we are pleased to announce that another fantastic version of the product, StatEasy - Release 10, is now available. We hope you enjoy using this new release, and as always, we welcome and appreciate your feedback.
					</p>

							<li>
								Release upgrade notification
								<ul>
									<li>
										The StatEasy team does not want you to miss out on any of the great new features or enhancements in our new releases, so we want to make sure you know when your system has been upgraded to the latest release. With StatEasy - Release 10, we have added a notification that appears at the top of the screen when your system is first upgraded to a new release. So, when you see a notification telling you that your system has been upgraded to the latest release, make sure you check out the release notes to see all of the new features you should be using.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Season management page enhancements
								<ul>
									<li>
										Users will notice that the look and feel of the season management page has changed in this release. Users can now expand and collapse different sections of the page so that they can see only the tournaments, matches, and/or games that matter to them at any given time.
									</li>
									<li>
										Users will also notice that a win/loss/tie record is now displayed on the season management page. The page displays a rolled-up record for the season, and it also displays the record for each individual tournament, match, and game.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Sortable tables in statistics reports
								<ul>
									<li>
										Users are now able to sort a statistics report by any column on the report in either ascending or descending order.
									</li>

							<li>
								Player management added to season editing
								<ul>
									<li>
										In previous releases, users had to navigate to a separate section of the application to add players to and remove them from a season as well as to change player shortcuts and numbers. In this release, those player management features have been added to the season edit page so that users are able to perform those actions when editing a season.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Live views added to video replay page
								<ul>
									<li>
										Certain live views can now be seen on the video replay page so that users can see game state information (rotation, score, serve, etc.) during video playback.
									</li>
									<li>
										One of the live views that can be seen on the video replay page is a new view that gives users the ability to telestrate directly on the video and see that telestration on a two dimensional view of the court.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								New validation/error messages
								<ul>
									<li>
										Users will notice a whole new look and feel to the validation/error messages that appear when using StatEasy.
									</li>
									<li>
										Also, the StatEasy team has added more informative validation/error messages to the feature that enables users to customize a statistics report.
									</li>
								</ul>

						What issues have been addressed in this release?
					</h1>

					<p style="color:#E0E0E0;font-family:verdana,news gothic,arial,heltevica,serif;font-size:16px;line-height:26px;">
						<ul style="color:#E0E0E0;font-family:verdana,news gothic,arial,heltevica,serif;font-size:16px;line-height:26px;">
							<li>
								The "Take Stats Now" feature is now working as expected.
								<ul>
									<li>
										A few issues that were found in Release 9 with the "Take Stats Now" feature (the main issue being one that made it appear as if the statistics that were captured with the feature had not been saved) have been addressed in this release.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Editing and/or deleting statistics that have already been captured for a game will now update the game's score automatically.
							</li>
							<li>
								Users can now launch StatEasy while having another instance of Firefox open.
							</li>
							<li>
								Users are now able to use numbers for statistic shortcuts. In previous releases, a statistic's shortcut could only contain letters.
							</li>
							<li>
								Although it would be rare (and essentially non-existent for some sports), users can now enter negative numbers as data for a statistic.
							</li>
							<li>
								With regard to synchronizing statistics to video, an issue has been addressed that may have caused some users to see a message such as "You are trying to put this statistic too early/late in the game."
							</li>
						</ul>
